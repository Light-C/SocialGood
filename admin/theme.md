In our community, there are many elderly people who are lonely and unaccompanied all year round because their children go out to work. Due to the long-term lack of social contact, their life is very bad.

We want to make a software that combines the apps of community workers, the elderly and sponsor manufacturers. This app can be used to enrich the life of the elderly. Activities are released by community workers and participated by the elderly. These activities are sponsored by manufacturers to promote their products. The main purpose of the activity is to let the elderly in the community know each other and make them no longer lonely. Teach them to use mobile phones and integrate into society. Do some proper exercise and medical science popularization to keep them away from illness.

This app has the following functions:

1. The app is divided into two parts, one is the user part and the other is the manager part.

2. For the user part, the elderly can find activities held by the community in the app, guide the elderly to participate in activities at the designated place, scan QR code for check-in, etc. participating in activities can obtain points, and points can cash in some goods.

[comment]: <> "three For the manager part, it is managed by community staff. They can publish activity information on it and contact manufacturers to promote their activities."
